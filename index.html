      <p>The future of technology and the future of game development is Unreal Engine 5. The main thing Unreal engine 5 tackles is lighting and how it interacts with objects in game to make the scenery more realistic.
          There is also a great improvement in detail without the loss of frame rates that Unreal engine 4 could never have accomplished. It is technology that will make gaming better and give the developers a new goal to achieve.</p>
