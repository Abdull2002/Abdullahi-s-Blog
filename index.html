        The future of technology and <u>the future of game development is Unreal Engine 5</u>. The main thing Unreal engine 5 tackles is lighting and how it interacts with objects in game to make the scenery more realistic.
        There is also a great improvement in detail without the loss of frame rates that Unreal engine 4 could never have accomplished. It is technology that will make gaming better and give the developers a new goal to achieve.

        <b>Unreal Engine</b> uses the programming language C++ a very powerful coding language used by even Unity. It is a language used in game development where optimal resource utilization and performance are the priority.  
        Unreal also has a visual scripting language called Blueprint that allows for people to get into game development without having to a programming language C++.
